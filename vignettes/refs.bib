    abstract = { The biological world is highly stochastic and inhomogeneous in its behaviour. There are regions in DNA with a high concentration of G or C bases; stretches of sequences with an abundance of CG dinucleotide (CpG islands); coding regions with strong periodicity-of-three pattern, and so forth. Transitions between these regions of DNA, known also as change points, carry important biological information. Computational methods used to identify these homogeneous regions are called segmentations. Viewing a DNA sequence as a non-stationary process, we apply recent novel techniques of universal source coding to discover stationary (possibly recurrent) segments. In particular, the Stein-Ziv lemma is adopted to find an asymptotically optimal discriminant function that determines whether two DNA segments are generated by the same source assuring exponentially small false positives. Next, we use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to select parameters that lead to a linear-time segmentation algorithm. We apply our algorithm to human chromosome 9 and chromosome 20 to discover coding and noncoding regions, starting positions of genes, as well as the beginning of CpG islands. }

abstract="The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexibility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.

abstract={The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm has O(n2) time complexity, which indicates that it is hard to process large-scale time series within an acceptable time. Recently, many researchers have used graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the algorithm. Owing to the data dependence of DTW, however, most of existing GPU-based DTW algorithms exploits task-level parallelism by simply replicating the serial algorithm on every multiprocessor of a GPU. The fundamental issue with such coarse-grained parallelism is that the solvable problem size is severely limited by the share memory and cache of a GPU multiprocessor. In this study, we introduce a specific transformation of data dependence by using prefix computations. Further, we propose an efficient GPU-parallel DTW algorithm to address the problem of instance sizes limitation. The efficiency of our algorithm is validated through experiments, which demonstrate improved performance over existing GPU-based task-level parallel DTW algorithms. Our experimental results indicate speedups up to 99 times faster on NVIDIA GTX480, compared to CPU implementations.},

abstract={Recent years have seen significant progress in improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of time series classification. However, because the best solution is typically the Nearest Neighbor algorithm with the relatively expensive Dynamic Time Warping as the distance measure, successful deployments on resource constrained devices remain elusive. Moreover, the recent explosion of interest in wearable devices, which typically have limited computational resources, has created a growing need for very efficient classification algorithms. A commonly used technique to glean the benefits of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, without inheriting its undesirable time complexity, is to use the Nearest Centroid algorithm. However, because of the unique properties of (most) time series data, the centroid typically does not resemble any of the instances, an unintuitive and underappreciated fact. In this work we show that we can exploit a recent result to allow meaningful averaging of 'warped' times series, and that this result allows us to create ultra-efficient Nearest 'Centroid' classifiers that are at least as accurate as their more lethargic Nearest Neighbor cousins.},

IDTW extends the classic DTW by providing accurate comparison between incomplete (the user's) and complete (the expert's) sequences while significantly reducing the computational time. Instead of providing a single measurement, the proposed method maps the IDTW measurements to a color-coded skeleton frame. Different colors on the limbs provide the user with an easy-to-interpret evaluation of how he or she is performing. Preliminary analysis involving different users and exercises and comparisons against the classic DTW algorithm show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The main idea behind this distance is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The higher compression rate between two time series is, the closer they should be. Besides, we also propose a relaxed version of the new distance, called the Extended Compression Rate Distance. The Extended Compression Rate Distance can satisfy some crucial characteristics on time series such as Early Abandoning, Lower Bounding, and Relaxed-Triangular Inequality which help the new distance easily adapt with traditional indexing structures and searching methods. We tested our distances on classification problem with numerous datasets and compared the results with most of the commonly used distances in time series such as Euclidean Distance, Dynamic Time Warping, and a recently proposed Complexity-Invariant Distance. Experimental results reveal that our novel distances outperform several previous important distance measures in a vast majority of the datasets.},

abstract="Time series data are pervasive across all human endeavors, and clustering is arguably the most fundamental data mining application. Given this, it is somewhat surprising that the problem of time series clustering from a single stream remains largely unsolved. Most work on time series clustering considers the clustering of individual time series that have been carefully extracted from their original context, for example, gene expression profiles, individual heartbeats, or individual gait cycles. The few attempts at clustering time series streams have been shown to be objectively incorrect in some cases, and in other cases shown to work only on the most contrived synthetic datasets by carefully adjusting a large set of parameters. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions that allow for the first time, the meaningful clustering of subsequences from a time series stream. First, we show that the problem definition for time series clustering from streams currently used is inherently flawed, and a new definition is necessary. Second, we show that the minimum description length framework offers an efficient, effective, and essentially parameter-free method for time series clustering. We show that our method produces objectively correct results on a wide variety of datasets from medicine, speech recognition, zoology, gesture recognition, and industrial process analyses.",

Our constraint uses the Minimum Description Length principle to decide whether the instance should be added into the positive set or not. If the Description Length decreases when adding the new instance, we accept to add it, otherwise, we reject it. After the constraint-based self-training process, we continue to select more positive instances in the boundary of the positive set and the negative set. For the second step, we define a safe distance which is the sum of mean and standard deviation of the distances between pairs of nearest instances in the positive set. We select more instances to add into the positive set if its distance to the positive set is less than or equal to the safe distance. Experimental results show that our novel method can provide more accurate semi-supervised classifiers of time series.},

abstract={Most algorithms for mining or indexing time series data do not operate directly on the original data, but instead they consider alternative representations that include transforms, quantization, approximation, and multi-resolution abstractions. Choosing the best representation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical step in time series data mining. In this paper, we investigate techniques to discover the natural intrinsic representation model, dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. The ability to discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting the best parameters for particular algorithms, as characterizing data in such a manner is useful in its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification, clustering and outlier discovery. We will frame the discovery of these intrinsic features in the Minimal Description Length (MDL) framework. Extensive empirical tests show that our method is simpler, more general and significantly more accurate than previous methods, and has the important advantage of being essentially parameter-free.},

This annotation, requiring the attention of medical experts is very expensive and time consuming, and remains the critical bottleneck in medical analysis. Semi-supervised learning is an obvious way to mitigate the need for human labor, however, most such algorithms are designed for intrinsically discrete objects, and do not work well in this domain, which requires the ability to deal with real-valued objects arriving in a streaming fashion. In this work we make two contributions. First, we demonstrate that in many cases just a handful of human annotated examples are sufficient to perform accurate classification. Second, we devise a novel parameter-free stopping criterion for semi-supervised learning. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse medical data sources including electrocardiograms. Our experimental results show that our approach can construct accurate classifiers even if given only a single annotated instance.},

abstract = {Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.},

abstract={Understanding the connectome of the human brain is a major challenge in neuroscience. Discovering the wiring and the major cables of the brain is essential for a better understanding of brain function. Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI) provides the potential way of exploring the organization of white matter fiber tracts in human subjects in a non-invasive way. However, it is a long way from the approximately one million voxels of a raw DT image to utilizable knowledge. After preprocessing including registration and motion correction, fiber tracking approaches extract thousands of fibers from diffusion weighted images. In this paper, we focus on the question how we can identify meaningful groups of fiber tracks which represent the major cables of the brain. We combine ideas from time series mining with density-based clustering to a novel framework for effective and efficient fiber clustering. We first introduce a novel fiber similarity measure based on dynamic time warping. This fiber warping measure successfully captures local similarity among fibers belonging to a common bundle but having different start and end points. A lower bound on this fiber warping measure speeds up computation. The result of fiber tracking often contains imperfect fibers and outliers. Therefore, we combine fiber warping with an outlier-robust density-based clustering algorithm. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns motifs, because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition, it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification.

abstract={Monitoring predefined patterns in streaming time series is useful to applications such as trend-related analysis, sensor networks and video surveillance. Most current studies on such monitoring employ Euclidean distance to calculate the similarities between given query patterns and subsequences of streaming time series. Euclidean distance has been shown to be ineffective in measuring distances of time series in which shifting and scaling usually exist. Consequently, warping distances such as dynamic time warping (DTW), longest common subsequence (LCSS), have been proposed to handle warps in temporal dimension. However, they are inadequate in handling shifting and scaling in amplitude dimension. Moreover, they have been designed mainly for full sequence matching, whereas in online monitoring applications, we typically have no knowledge on the positions and lengths of possible matching subsequences. In this paper, we first discuss the weaknesses of existing warping distances on detecting patterns from streaming time series. We then propose a novel warping distance, which we name Spatial Assembling Distance (SpADe), that is able to handle shifting and scaling in both temporal and amplitude dimensions. We further propose an efficient approach for continuous pattern detection using SpADe, that is fundamental for subsequence matching on streaming data. Finally, our experimental results show that SpADe is effective and efficient for continuous pattern detection in streaming time series.},

In this work, we make a surprising claim. Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising because it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations of previous work. Although the primary contribution of our work is to draw attention to the fact that an apparent solution to an important problem is incorrect and should no longer be used, we also introduce a novel method that, based on the concept of time-series motifs, is able to meaningfully cluster subsequences on some time-series datasets.

With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works."

abstract={The all-pairs-similarity-search (or similarity join) problem has been extensively studied for text and a handful of other datatypes. However, surprisingly little progress has been made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas for two time series data mining problems, including motif discovery and novelty discovery.},

abstract={Activity recognition is a hot topic in context-aware computing. In activity recognition, machine learning techniques have been widely applied to learn the activity models from labeled activity samples. Since labeling samples requires human's efforts, most existing research in activity recognition focus on refining learning techniques to utilize the costly labeled samples as effectively as possible. However, few of them consider using the costless unlabeled samples to boost learning performance. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm named En-Co-training to make use of the unlabeled samples. Our algorithm extends the co- training paradigm by using ensemble method. Experimental results show that En-Co-training is able to utilize the available unlabeled samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number of labeled samples.},

abstract={Motion classification using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors have been an important area of exploration for the past decade. Mostly studied in the context of health related applications, the implications of accurate inertial-magnetic motion classification span from continuous daily activity monitoring and remote assessment of patients recovery to athlete optimization and entertainment applications. While much has been done to optimize classification and segmentation algorithms, very little is understood of the effect sensor selection and motion representation has on overall system performance. In this paper, three sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation), seven motion representations and six classification techniques (K Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes) are compared. In addition to traditional time domain motion representations, a novel space domain representation is put forth which results in a two order of magnitude reduction in computational complexity. A case study dataset is created from 11 individuals performing 10 repetitions of 10 different upper body exercises. A single bicep mounted smart phone is used for data collection and both action classification and non-action rejection ability are studied.},

abstract="In this work, algorithms are developed and evaluated to detect physical activities from data acquired using five small biaxial accelerometers worn simultaneously on different parts of the body. Acceleration data was collected from 20 subjects without researcher supervision or observation. Subjects were asked to perform a sequence of everyday tasks but not told specifically where or how to do them. Mean, energy, frequency-domain entropy, and correlation of acceleration data was calculated and several classifiers using these features were tested. Decision tree classifiers showed the best performance recognizing everyday activities with an overall accuracy rate of 84{\%}. The results show that although some activities are recognized well with subject-independent training data, others appear to require subject-specific training data. The results suggest that multiple accelerometers aid in recognition because conjunctions in acceleration feature values can effectively discriminate many activities. With just two biaxial accelerometers -- thigh and wrist -- the recognition performance dropped only slightly. This is the first work to investigate performance of recognition algorithms with multiple, wire-free accelerometers on 20 activities using datasets annotated by the subjects themselves.",

The presented methods use individuals’ characteristics, transport mode specifications and data related to places of work and residence. The dataset analyzed comes from a national survey. It contains information on the daily mobility (e.g., from home to work) of individuals who either live or work in Luxembourg. We extracted individual characteristics to relate daily movements (journeys between home and work, in particular) to the characteristics of working individuals. We used the information about public transportation and some geographical location of the residential and work places. We compare the rates of successful prediction obtained by neural networks and several alternative approaches for predicting the travel mode choice using cross-validation. The results show that the artificial neural networks perform better compared to other alternatives. Our analysis can be used to support management decision-making and build predictions under uncertainty related to changes in people's behavior, economic context or environment and transportation infrastructure."

Errors of respondent input with respect to trip length and transport mode segmenting introduce a systematic bias in the classification model. We propose a semi-supervised framework adjusting user-given input to process user-collected accelerometer time series data. Our contributions are (1) an evaluation of the impact of segmentation bias, (2) a novel algorithm to find more homogeneous segments and (3) a robust incrementally trained classifier model based on clustering employing Dynamic Time Warping as similarity measure. We apply the proposed method on synthetic and real-world accelerometer trip data of 800 labeled trips consisting of 2000 user-given segments and 400 hours travel time and test it against a baseline classifier relying completely on user-feedback. The results prove that our method learns clusters revised from noise and increases the classifier's accuracy for real-world and synthetic data by up to 17{\%}.},

@article{Nitsche2014,
abstract = {Collection of travel data is a key task of transportation modeling. Data collection is currently based on costly and time-intensive questionnaires, and can thus only provide limited cross-sectional coverage and inadequate updates. There is an urgent need for technologically supported travel data acquisition tools. We present a novel approach for supporting travel surveys using data collected with smartphones. Individual trips of the person carrying the phone are automatically reconstructed and trip legs are classified into one of eight different modes of transport. This task is performed by an ensemble of probabilistic classifiers combined with a Discrete Hidden Markov Model (DHMM). Classification is based on features extracted from the motion trajectory recorded by the smartphone's positioning system and signals of the embedded accelerometer. Our approach can cope with GPS signal losses by including positioning data obtained from the mobile phone cell network, and relies solely on accelerometer features when the trajectory cannot be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. To train and evaluate the models, 355. h of probe travel data were collected in the metropolitan area of Vienna, Austria by 15 volunteers over a period of 2. months. Distinguishing eight different transportation modes, the classification results range from 65{\%} (train, subway) to 95{\%} (bicycle). The increasing popularity of smartphones gives the proposed method the potential to be used on a wide-spread basis and can complement existing travel survey methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
